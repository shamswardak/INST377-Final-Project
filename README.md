**What API did I use, link to the API**

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02

**What visualisations does my project drive?**

My site provides an interactive map visualization that shows users the locations of the highest magnitude earthquakes for the selected time period.

**What visualisation or other JS libraries does my project use?**

I used Leaflet.JS to create my map visualization. I used Fetch API to fetch my data from the API.

**What CSS frameworks did I use? What version of them?**

My styles were written using standard CSS syntax

**What is your actual project trying to display and solve?**

With this project, I aimed to solve the problem of Data Overload and Inaccessibility. Data was overloaded into the API and made the data difficult to understand or access. With my site, users can select dates and be presented with the data of earthquakes in that period of time along with an interactive map visual showing the strongest earthquakes. I hope that users will not be overloaded with data when using my site and that it is relatively simple for them to access it.
