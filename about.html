        <h2>API</h2>
        <p>
          I used the
          <a
            href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02"
            >USGS Earthquake API</a
          >
          to fetch earthquake data.

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <p>
          My site provides an interactive map visualization that shows users the
          locations of the highest magnitude earthquakes for the selected time
          period.

        <h2>JS Libraries</h2>
        <p>
          I used <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.JS</a> to create the
          map visualization. I utilized the Fetch API to retrieve data from the
          API.

        <h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          My styles were written using standard CSS syntax without any specific
          CSS frameworks.

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          With this project, I aimed to solve the problem of Data Overload and
          Inaccessibility. The API contained a large amount of data that was
          difficult to understand or access. My site allows users to select
          specific dates and presents them with earthquake data for that period
          along with an interactive map showing the strongest earthquakes. I
          hope that my site simplifies the data access process and prevents
          users from being overwhelmed with excessive information.
